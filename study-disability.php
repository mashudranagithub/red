					<p>Persons with disabilities (PWDs) not only face widespread barriers in accessing healthcare services, education, employment and social services, but also are likely to experience social stigma, discrimination, inequality and disrespect, among many other hardships in their daily lives (Moniruzzaman et al., 2016). Case studies in various settings have found that people with physical, cognitive or mental impairments tend to face multiple barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities (Moniruzzaman et al., 2016). These barriers include technical challenges with the physical setting of the WASH facilities (Dey et al., 2015), environmental challenges such as scarcity of water as well as unsafe water (Dey et al., 2017; Saha et al., 2019); increased drudgery to collect safe water for drinking and other household chores (Dey et al., 2018), all of which add sufferings to the PWDs. Many diseases occurring in rural areas of Bangladesh seem to stem from a lack of awareness about cleanliness including hygiene, low-cost infrastructure including tubewells, and low-quality latrines (Dey et al., 2015), which consequences additional miseries to PWDs. Institutional barriers also tend to overlook the needs of disabled people or prevent their participation in WASH related activities, design and delivery. In March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease, Covid-19, to be a pandemic, due to the speed and scale of transmission. Newly invested antiviral medicine or vaccine for 2019-nCOV, the virus responsible for this disease is available till now, maintaining hand and respiratory hygiene, and keeping social distance from others have been widely recommended by WHO and other health authorities to prevent the spreading of COVID-19. However, WHO fears that certain populations, such as those with disability, may be impacted more significantly by COVID-19 because of barriers to implementing basic hygiene measures, such as handwashing, difficulty in enacting social distancing, barriers to accessing public health information and so on. Furthermore, it is most likely that they will face the fear and stigma factors more than those with no disability. Hence, it is of enormous importance to understand whether or not the people with disabilities and/or their care-givers are aware of the basic protection measures against COVID-19, to what extent these knowledge are practiced, what are the challenges and barriers to follow the protection measures, and how they are overcoming these barriers and challenges.</p>
					<p>Situation analysis to promote regulations for improving protection for persons with disability against COVID-19 pandemic: A phenomenological study</p>
					<p>The study investigates the current scenario of the PWDs due to Covid-19 pandemic in Dhaka and Gazipur city corporation areas. The main aim of the study was to comprehend the current barriers and challenges faced by PWDs for acquiring correct and continuous information regarding Covid-19 from various media sources, practicing recommended public health strategies and gaps in existing policies and formulate policy recommendation due to Covid-19. The study follows a qualitative investigative path following phenomenological approaches through in-depth and key informant interview of the PWDs and experts. Findings reveal that health messaging is not always accessible to the disability community, leaving them side-lined. The Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and other relevant websites are not accessible and not disabled friendly for those with visual impairment. Most of the web portals and TV News channels are not accessible for PWDs.  TV News channels are not always telecasting sign language interpreters for hearing impaired people, only few TV channels are telecasting sign language interpreters but those are not seen properly due to frequent transmission of TV commercials and other income generating ads for TV channels. Thus, sign language interpreters are only shown during news telecast in a, small or limited visual scale on mass media forums. Struggling to get information and updates on Covid-19 on their own these PWDs get vital information from family members/ friends through online platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Viber, IMO through sign language and lip reading. Mask wearing is also a barrier for them as they canâ€™t read lips of others as they wear masks during telecast. The equitable access to healthcare before and during the pandemic is an established barrier worsened by COVID-19. This ranges from getting a coronavirus test to being seen in an emergency room at a hospital. There are also existing barriers in health care settings that are worsened now as the country aims to meet the surge of Covid-19 cases. Moreover, the allocation of medical resources is a concern as shortages of medical test kits, equipment and other materials are already in shortage let alone being there for PWD. There's fear that medical resource allocation, including ventilators, may be discriminatory against patients with disabilities, as this issue echoes an underlying misconception that people with disabilities can't have good survival rate due to their existing co-morbidities  and therefore the lives of disabled people may not be prioritized during a pandemic like Covid-19. Additionally, nearly all of our interviews revealed that livelihoods of PWDs (e.g. jobs, business etc.) of all types (Physical, mental, visual and deaf) have been affected due to this pandemic (nearly >50% reduced) and they had become food insecure due to the pandemic. The families of PWDs were struggling to make their ends meet and thus facing hardship to maintain the expenses of their PWDs they were taking care of.</p>
