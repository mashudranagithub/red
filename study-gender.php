					<p>Women's empowerment is an important aspect of achieving gender equality. It includes increasing a woman's sense of self-worth, her decision-making power, her access to opportunities and resources, her power and control over her own life inside and outside the home, and her ability to result change. Nearly 60 per cent of women work in the informal economy, which puts them at greater risk of falling into poverty (UN 2021). The country ranks 50th out of 153 countries in the 2020 Gender Gap Index (GGI), just above the United States and way ahead of all other South Asian and most African nations.</p>
