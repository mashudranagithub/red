					<p>An entrepreneur is the person with the initiative to form a business with his dexterity of creative thinking. S/he is consistent to develop an enterprise being independent, self-motivated and industrious. S/he retains all the factors of production and reassembles the thinking to produce something new in the society. Being a risk taker, entrepreneur develops a business entity for the betterment of the country as a whole (Chowdhury, 2017). Most of the developed nations spend a lionâ€™s share in this sector to develop their industry but we do not invest huge amount in this sector for the development of our industry. Thus a lack of Research and Development facilities hampers our innovation, strength and growth in this sector. R&D plays a big role in entrepreneurship development as suggested by Dierickx and Cool (1989) the amount of R&D spending is a flow variable that may be adjusted instantaneously (Deeds, 2001).</p>
