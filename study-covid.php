					<p>COVID-19 has caused an uproar and havoc in the lives of 7.8 billion people across the world in some form or way. It has been a conundrum for many to fathom but less to understand about. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced millions of people to go into lockdown and self-isolation and resulted in potential poverty traps due to loss of income and maintaining livelihoods. However, the pandemic has had the most impact on the lives of people who are poor and persons with disabilities (PWDs). Poor people living in both the urban slums and hard to reach areas have suffered the most and have borne the destructive brunt of the pandemic.</p>
					<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has started a global economic recession resulting in a massive loss of livelihoods and income on a global scale (World Bank, 2020a). Thus the resulting drop in purchasing power among those who lost income has had a major impact on food security and nutrition, especially for those that were already vulnerable. The latest South Asia Economic Focus anticipates a sharp economic slump in each of the regionâ€™s eight countries, caused by halting economic activity, collapsing trade, and greater stress in the financial and banking sectors (Bangladesh Must Ramp Up COVID-19Action to Protect Its People, Revive Economy, 2020). The World Bank estimates that more than 50 million people earning less than $2 a day may fall below the lower poverty line in Bangladesh due to the Covid-19 pandemic(Food Security and Covid-19, 2020) Nearly 32 percent of Bangladeshis still live below the national poverty line, according to the UN World Food Program (WFP).  A number of factors have emerged that are affecting food systems and food security and nutrition thus far, including: disruptions to food supply chains; loss of income and livelihoods; a widening of inequality; disruptions to social protection programmes; altered food environments; and uneven food prices in localized contexts (see, e.g. Klassen and Murphy, 2020; Clapp and Moseley, 2020; Laborde et al., 2020). The World Food Programme estimates that about 130 million people will face acute hunger as a result of the crisis, nearly doubling the 135 million people already facing acute hunger (Khorsandi, 2020).</p>
